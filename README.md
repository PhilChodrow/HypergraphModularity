# Hypergraph Clustering: From Blockmodels to Modularities

*Phil Chodrow (UCLA), Nate Veldt (Cornell), and Austin Benson (Cornell)*

Code for a forthcoming preprint on hypergraph clustering via maximum-likelihood inference in a degree-corrected hypergraph stochastic blockmodel. The code in this repository is sufficient to reproduce the main results and figures of the preprint. We intend to release soon a Julia package for hypergraph clustering via the presented methods. 

You can also access the data sets used in this paper [hosted](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/#hyperlabels) on Austin Benson's website.
