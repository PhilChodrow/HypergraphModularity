"""
The way the Louvain code works, you start with n clusters (singletons), and as nodes
move, many of these become empty. At certain points in the algorithm, it is
helpful to renumber the cluster IDs, so that they go from 1 to M where
M = number of non-empty clusters.

e.g. c = [2 3 5 3 9] ---> c = [1 2 3 2 4]

This version does this with both the Clusters array of arrays AND
the cluster indicator vector c:

c[i] = (integer) cluster ID that node i belongs to
Clusters[j] = (integer array) node IDs for nodes in cluster j
