These hypergraph data sets were extracted from the U.S. Congressional committee assignment data hosted by Charles Stewart at 

> `http://web.mit.edu/17.251/www/data_page.html#2`.

Each node is a legislator (member of the House or senator), and each hyperedge is a House or Senate committee in a given meeting of Congress. 
The data set spans the 103rd through 115th Congresses. 
A node is included in an edge if that legislator is a member of the associated committee in the meeting of Congress.
